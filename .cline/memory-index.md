## Project Summary

Fluxivity is a reactive state management library for Dart and Flutter applications. It provides a set of primitives for building reactive applications with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

### Key Components

1. **Reactive\<T\>**: The foundational building block for reactive state
   - Tracks changes to values and notifies listeners
   - Supports middleware for intercepting updates
   - Provides batch update capabilities

2. **Computed\<T\>**: Derived values that update automatically
   - Depends on other reactive values
   - Recalculates only when dependencies change
   - Follows the same notification pattern as Reactive

3. **Reactive Collections**: Reactive collections for lists and other collection types
   - ✅ Simplified implementation for better reliability and performance
   - Leverages extension methods on standard Dart collections
   - Maintains a consistent API across collection types

4. **FluxivityMiddleware\<T\>**: Plugin system
   - Intercepts updates for cross-cutting concerns
   - Provides hooks for the reactive lifecycle
   - Enables extensibility and separation of concerns

### Current Status

The library is currently in a **stable maintenance phase with active improvements**. The core reactive state management functionality is complete and working as intended. The focus is on:

1. ✅ Reactive List implementation improved (v1.6.0)
2. Enhancing documentation and examples
3. Developing reactive Map and Set implementations
4. Expanding the middleware ecosystem

## Memory Status

- **Memory Initialization Date**: 2025-05-08
- **Last Memory Update**: 2025-05-08 (16:00)
- **Memory Health**: ✅ Good
- **Memory Consistency**: ✅ Verified

## Implementation Highlights

| Feature | Status | Location | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Core Reactive System | ✅ Complete | `lib/core/reactive.dart` | Foundation of the library |
| Computed Values | ✅ Complete | `lib/core/computed.dart` | Derived state management |
| Reactive Collections | ✅ Complete | `lib/core/reactive_list_simplified.dart` | Simplified implementation with improved reliability |
| Middleware System | ✅ Complete | `lib/plugins/plugin_abstract.dart` | Plugin architecture |
| Batch Updates | ✅ Complete | Multiple files | Optimized update propagation |
| Flutter Example | ✅ Complete | `example/counter/` | Demonstrates core functionality |

## Recent Achievements

- ✅ Simplified ReactiveList implementation for better reliability
- ✅ Fixed notification issues with list mutations
- ✅ Improved batch update handling in collections
- ✅ Enhanced subscription management in Computed class
- ✅ Better resource cleanup with more robust disposal methods
- ✅ Released version 1.6.0 with these improvements

## Future Memory Tasks

- [ ] Update documentation for the new ReactiveList implementation
- [ ] Create implementation plans for reactive Map and Set collections
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing old and new implementations
- [ ] Document plans for Flutter widget integrations
- [ ] Update memory files as the project evolves
