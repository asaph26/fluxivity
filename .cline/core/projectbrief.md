# Project Brief: Fluxivity

## Overview
Fluxivity is a reactive state management library for Dart and Flutter applications. It provides a set of primitives for building reactive applications with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

## Core Features
- **Reactive Values**: Track changes to values and notify listeners
- **Computed Values**: Automatically derive values from reactive sources
- **Reactive Collections**: Observe changes to list data structures
- **Middleware System**: Intercept and augment the update process
- **Batch Operations**: Group updates to optimize performance

## Key Components
1. `Reactive<T>`: The fundamental building block for observable state
2. `Computed<T>`: Derived values that update automatically when dependencies change
3. `ReactiveListWrapper<E>`: Collection wrapper with reactive properties
4. `FluxivityMiddleware<T>`: Interface for creating interceptors and plugins

## Target Use Cases
- Flutter application state management
- Reactive UI programming
- Data-driven application architectures
- Event-based systems

## Design Philosophy
Fluxivity embraces reactive programming principles while providing a clean, type-safe API that feels natural to Dart developers. It focuses on being lightweight and composable, allowing developers to build complex reactive systems from simple components.
