# Product Context: Fluxivity

## Problem Space

### State Management Challenges in Flutter
Flutter applications often struggle with efficient state management as they grow in complexity. Developers face several common challenges:

1. **Prop Drilling**: Passing state through multiple widget layers becomes cumbersome
2. **Synchronization**: Keeping UI in sync with application state
3. **Reactivity**: Efficiently updating only the parts of the UI that depend on changed state
4. **Testability**: Creating maintainable and testable state logic
5. **Complexity**: Managing increasing state complexity as applications grow

### Existing Solutions and Their Limitations
- **setState**: Simple but limited to local widget state, doesn't scale well
- **Provider**: Better composition but requires more boilerplate for complex states
- **Bloc/Cubit**: Powerful but introduces significant complexity
- **GetX**: Full-featured but often criticized for magic and hidden complexity
- **Redux**: Structured but verbose with significant boilerplate
- **MobX**: Reactive but requires code generation

## User Needs

### Target Audience
- Flutter/Dart developers building medium to complex applications
- Teams looking for a lightweight yet powerful state management solution
- Developers who prefer explicit, transparent reactivity without excessive boilerplate
- Applications with complex, interconnected state requirements

### Key User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to create reactive state that automatically updates my UI when changed
2. As a developer, I want to compose and derive new state from existing state
3. As a developer, I want to intercept and modify state updates for logging, validation, or other cross-cutting concerns
4. As a developer, I want to batch state updates to avoid excessive UI rebuilds
5. As a developer, I want to work with reactive collections to track changes to lists of data
6. As a developer, I want a simple API that feels natural to Dart and doesn't require extensive boilerplate

## Value Proposition
Fluxivity provides a minimalist yet powerful approach to reactive state management in Dart/Flutter with these key benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive API with minimal boilerplate
2. **Flexibility**: Composable primitives that work together seamlessly
3. **Transparency**: Explicit reactivity without magic or hidden complexity
4. **Performance**: Optimized updates through batching and fine-grained reactivity
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for customizing behavior

## Use Case Scenarios

### Single-Screen Application
In a counter application, Fluxivity provides a simple way to create reactive state and bind it to the UI:
```dart
final counter = Reactive<int>(0);
// In widget: counter.value++; 
// StreamBuilder(stream: counter.stream, ...)
```

### Multi-Screen Application
For more complex applications, Fluxivity allows creating interconnected reactive state:
```dart
final user = Reactive<User>(User());
final isAdmin = Computed([user], (sources) => sources[0].value.role == 'admin');
```

### Form Management
Fluxivity simplifies managing form state with derived validation:
```dart
final email = Reactive<String>('');
final password = Reactive<String>('');
final isFormValid = Computed([email, password], 
  (sources) => isEmailValid(sources[0].value) && sources[1].value.length > 6);
```

### Data-Heavy Applications
For applications with collections of data, ReactiveList provides observable collections:
```dart
final tasks = <Task>[].toReactive();
// tasks.value.add(Task()); // Automatically notifies listeners
```
