#### Flutter Compatibility
While not dependent on Flutter, Fluxivity is designed to work seamlessly with Flutter applications:

- Compatible with Flutter's widget rebuilding model
- Integrates with `StreamBuilder` for UI updates
- Supports Flutter's development patterns and conventions
- Works across all Flutter supported platforms

### Build System

- **Dart build system** for compilation and optimization
- **pub package manager** for dependency management

## Implementation Details

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Stream-based Reactivity**
   - Decision: Use Dart's Stream API as the foundation for reactivity
   - Rationale: Streams are a core part of Dart, providing robust async support
   - Alternatives considered: Custom observer pattern implementation, signals
   - Trade-offs: Some learning curve for developers new to reactive streams

2. **BehaviorSubject from rxdart**
   - Decision: Use BehaviorSubject instead of standard StreamController
   - Rationale: Provides value caching and immediate value delivery to new subscribers
   - Alternatives considered: Custom caching implementation, plain StreamController
   - Trade-offs: Additional dependency, but with significant functionality benefits

3. **Middleware Interface**
   - Decision: Create an abstract class for middleware with lifecycle hooks
   - Rationale: Enables extensibility and separation of concerns
   - Alternatives considered: Function-based middleware, direct subclassing
   - Trade-offs: Slightly more verbose than function-based approaches but more flexible

4. **Value Equality for Change Detection**
   - Decision: Use value equality (`!=`) for change detection
   - Rationale: Simplicity and predictability for users
   - Alternatives considered: Deep equality, custom equality functions, identity equality
   - Trade-offs: Requires proper implementation of equality for complex objects

5. **Collection Delegation**
   - Decision: Use DelegatingList for reactive collections
   - Rationale: Maintains standard List API while adding reactivity
   - Alternatives considered: Custom list implementation, wrapper methods
   - Trade-offs: Some performance overhead but better developer experience

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch Updates**
   - Implementation: Counter-based batching system
   - Purpose: Reduce notification overhead for multiple sequential updates
   - Performance impact: Significant reduction in UI rebuilds

2. **Subscription Management**
   - Implementation: Proper disposal of stream subscriptions
   - Purpose: Prevent memory leaks and excessive computation
   - Performance impact: Critical for long-lived applications

3. **Cached Computation**
   - Implementation: Computed values only recalculate when dependencies change
   - Purpose: Avoid redundant calculations
   - Performance impact: Substantial for expensive derivations

### Technical Limitations

1. **Equality-Based Change Detection**
   - Limitation: Requires proper equality implementation for custom objects
   - Mitigation: Documentation guidance on implementing `==` and `hashCode`

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Limitation: Each Reactive instance maintains a BehaviorSubject
   - Mitigation: Proper disposal and lifecycle management

3. **Debug Overhead**
   - Limitation: Middleware can introduce performance overhead
   - Mitigation: Conditional middleware activation (dev/prod)

## Integration Points

### Flutter Integration

```dart
// Example of integration with Flutter
StreamBuilder<Snapshot<int>>(
  stream: counter.stream,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    return Text('Count: ${counter.value}');
  }
)
```

### Testing Integration

```dart
// Example of testing integration
test('Reactive value updates', () {
  final value = Reactive<int>(0);
  value.value = 1;
  expect(value.value, equals(1));
});
```

### Extension Points

1. **Custom Middleware**
   - Interface: `FluxivityMiddleware<T>`
   - Extension points:
     - `beforeUpdate`: Pre-processing of value changes
     - `afterUpdate`: Post-processing of value changes
     - `onError`: Error handling
     - `shouldEmit`: Filtering of change notifications

2. **Derived Value Computation**
   - Extension through `Computed<T>` constructor
   - Custom computation functions
   - Composition of multiple reactive sources
